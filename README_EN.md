```
Install Agent Skills for me:
1. Clone https://github.com/CarGod/luffy-skills.git into ~/skills (if it already exists, run git pull to update)
2. If ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills doesn't exist, create a symlink pointing to ~/skills
3. Install Python dependencies for video-subtitle-extractor: pip install -r ~/skills/video-subtitle-extractor/requirements.txt
4. Check if the GEMINI_ANTIGRAVITY_KEY environment variable is set. If not, remind me to get one at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and configure it
```

## 🤝 What is an Agent Skill?

An Agent Skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file that extends an AI Agent's capabilities. Each skill provides structured instructions telling the agent when and how to use it, and may include scripts, reference documentation, and resource templates.
